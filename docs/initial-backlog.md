## Notes

- This backlog will be continuously updated as the project evolves
- Priority will be assigned to items based on project needs
- Items may be moved between phases as requirements change
- New items will be added through the GitHub issue system

## Getting Started

To contribute to this backlog:

1. Review the items listed above
2. Create GitHub issues for specific tasks
3. Add appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, research, etc.)
4. Issues will be automatically added to the project board
5. Discuss and refine requirements in the issue comments
