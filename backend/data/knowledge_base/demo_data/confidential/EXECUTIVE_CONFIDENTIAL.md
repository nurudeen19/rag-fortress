## RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION

### Strategic Risks

**Market Risk - RAG/LLM Market Consolidation:**
- **Risk:** Large tech companies (Google, Microsoft, AWS) build in-house
- **Probability:** High (likely within 2-3 years)
- **Impact:** High (could kill market opportunity)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Accelerate Series C funding (2026)
  - Build defensible moat (unique features, customer lock-in)
  - Pursue strategic exit before consolidation

**Competitive Risk - Elasticsearch Dominance:**
- **Risk:** Elasticsearch integrates RAG, undercuts pricing
- **Probability:** Medium (likely 18-24 months out)
- **Impact:** Medium (impacts pricing power)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Win customers aggressively now
  - Build customer lock-in through integrations
  - Focus on vertical markets they don't serve

**Technology Risk - Vector DB Commoditization:**
- **Risk:** Vector database becomes commodity/free (like search did)
- **Probability:** High (likely 3-5 years out)
- **Impact:** High (pricing pressure)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build higher-value applications on top
  - Expand into data integration, compliance, analytics
  - Build sticky enterprise features

### Operational Risks

**Key Person Dependency:**
- **Risk:** Loss of CEO or CTO could derail company
- **Probability:** Low annually, high over 5 years
- **Impact:** High (company continuation at risk)
- **Mitigation:**

  - CTO knowledge documentation and training
  - Key person insurance ($5-10M)
  - Competitive compensation and equity vesting

**Infrastructure Outage:**
- **Risk:** Extended outage affecting enterprise customers
- **Probability:** Low (99.95% uptime target)
- **Impact:** High (customer relationships, legal liability)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Multi-region deployment (2 AWS regions)
  - Disaster recovery drills quarterly
  - SLA guarantees with penalties ($50-200K per incident)
  - Insurance coverage for business interruption

### Financial Risks

**Cash Flow Risk - Slow Customer Growth:**
- **Risk:** Revenue growth slows, cash runway reduced
- **Probability:** Medium (market adoption risk)
- **Impact:** Medium (extends timeline to profitability)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Conservative spending (remain cash-flow positive)
  - Series C funding ready if needed (late 2026)

**Funding Risk - Market Downturn:**
- **Risk:** VC funding market freeze, Series C unavailable
- **Probability:** Medium-Low (macro risk)
- **Impact:** High (limits growth investment)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Already cash-flow positive (can operate independently)
  - Strong investor relationships (no need to fundraise)
  - Profitability path clear without additional funding
