Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
Semantic Caching: Implement semantic caching for RAG queries (if query A is semantically similar to query B, return cached result of B) to save embedding costs.
User Feedback Loop: Add endpoints to allow users to rate responses (thumbs up/down), which can be used to fine-tune the retrieval or intent classification logic.

## Overall System improvements

Frontend Security Audit

Token Response: The verify_token function returns only a user_id. Returning a structured object (e.g., TokenPayload with scopes/roles) would reduce database lookups for basic permission checks.

Document Ingestion Error Granularity: The pipeline catches generic Exception. Defining specific exceptions (e.g., ParsingError, EmbeddingError, StorageError) would allow for smarter retry logic (e.g., retry network errors, but fail permanently on parsing errors).
