Future Enhancements (Low Priority)
Semantic Caching: Implement semantic caching for RAG queries (if query A is semantically similar to query B, return cached result of B) to save embedding costs.
User Feedback Loop: Add endpoints to allow users to rate responses (thumbs up/down), which can be used to fine-tune the retrieval or intent classification logic.
